## Project Instructions
In this project you must write a program in the C programming language to calculate the [SHA512](https://www.nist.gov/publications/secure-hash-standard) value of an input file.
Your program must take the name or path of the file as a command line argument and output the SHA512 digest of it.
The program must be coded from scratch - you cannot use any external libraries other than what is included in the C standard library.
Your program must compile using `gcc` or `clang` and you must include a `Makefile` which compiles it upon `make` being called in the project folder.
You must also include tests which run upon `make test` being called, as will be described in lectures.
You should also include in your repository an appropriate `.gitignore` file and a `README.md` as described below.
