# SHA-512 Calculator
A repository for the main project for the module Theory of Algorithms.<br>
A program in the C programming language to calculate the SHA-512 (Secure Hash Standard) value of an input file.

All weekly Labs for the module are located in [this repository](https://github.com/johnshields/SHA-256).
